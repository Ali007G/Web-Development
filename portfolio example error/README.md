**#About Portfolio**

1. After html and css learn then i tried to make my portfolio. All the things works well, at the end navbar is not working that means navbar is not closing.
2. Then lots of search(almost 6 days) found the erorr/problem and solved it.
3. The problem is in the last part of body, i added 3 extra javascript code, that's why navbar is not closing.
4. When 3 extra javascript code deleted then navbar working properly.
